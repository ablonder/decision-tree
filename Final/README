DecisionTree.java - Takes the name of a csv file, the name of a decision tree algorithm (ID3, C4.5, C4.5NP, or C4.5NSI), and a random seed number in the form "java DecisionTree <csvfile> <algorithm> <seed>". It will then create a decision tree based on the file provided using the either the ID3 or C4.5 algorithm - the latter with or without pruning and split information - test it, and output a csv file with a name in the format <algorithm><dataset><seed>.csv that contains a confusion matrix detailing the results of the test.
Fixed several minor problems with the previous version, enabling all algorithms to run, though C4.5NP runs very slowly on both hypothyroid and opticalDigits, and C4.5 runs very slowly on hypothyroid.

DecisionTree.class, DecisionTree$1.class, DecisionTree$Tree.class and DecisionTree$InstanceComparator.class are the class files created by compiling DecisionTree.java using the makefile provided.
